A class to easily upload images to your Picasa account. 
It supports uploading all images in multiple folders and it keeps track of the uploaded files
to prevent it from uploading the same file twice for those long long uploading jobs.

Requires the gdata gem. If you're running Ruby 1.9.2 (as you should) type in 'gem install gdata19'

Here's an example how to upload all images in a folder recursively to a Picasa account:

require_relative 'lib/uploader.rb'

album_id = 5585265081311735361 # to find the album id go to your_account => the_album => rss

uploader = PicasaUploader.new(your_picasa_login_email, 
															your_picsa_login_password, 
															"http://picasaweb.google.com/data/feed/api/user/default/albumid/#{album_id}/")
															

uploader.upload_folder(Dir.getwd + '/test_images', true) # whatever folder you want plus true for recursive upload
puts "Uploading..."
puts "Type 'exit' to safely exit"

# This thread checks if the uploader worker thread is done and if so exits
check_finished = Thread.new do
	loop do
		unless uploader.working
			puts "Done!"
			exit
		end
		sleep 1
	end
end

# Enable the user to abort the upload. When calling abort_upload the thread will not kill itself until it has finished
# the current image upload.
loop do
	input = gets.chomp														
	if input == "exit"
		puts "Aborting upload..."
		check_finished.kill
		uploader.abort_upload
		puts "Done!"
		exit
	end
end
